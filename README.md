# Prison-Management-database-using-Streamlit-and-PostgreSQL
Created an online prison management system using Streamlit for frontend and PostgreSQL for backend of the project. The application
allows for viewing and adding of data in eleven different tables. The User can add new data of prisoners, prisons, staff etc. and can also
view year wise statistics of the prisoners. They can also allocate budget flow to each prison and add different federal sections to the
application
